# Gamepad2OSC
Using OSC, I commonly found it would be useful to have some kind of hardware to trigger packets for testing or prototyping. To that end I built a webapp that uses the GameController and fetch api
to send OSC messages in response to a game controller connected over bluetooth or usb.

## features

## setup

- install dependencies with `npm install`
- run the app with `npm start`
- open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

- [ ] ability to save and load settings from file
- [ ] ability to configure a button by pressing it instead of specifying button id
